These are things I've written that could have probably been written better/smaller/easier.

As of now, my current goal is to make as many POSIX, minimal-dependency scripts/programs as possible to replace "programs" that require non-base Unix-like install dependencies (including things like Python, where possible, as I use OpenBSD which does not come with Python on the base install).

This is not a slight against Python or other programming languages; I just figured it would be a fun experience and would help others like me that desire to keep a slim OS, where I (we) opt to use slightly more inconvenient scripts in exchange for not having to install 20MB+ in dependencies you wouldn't use if it weren't for that program.

Where dependencies are required, they're great! Especially if the dependencies a program requires are also required by another program you use. 

Enjoy! :)
