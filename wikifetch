# Wiki "fetcher" for the lazy men. 
# I prefer doing things in CLI so I made this to shorten 
# the time I am taking, opening up a text-based browser and going
# to Wikipedia. Because I'm the #1 lazy man in my life.
# This will fetch a Wiki page and open it in a browser of your choice.

# Usage: ./wikifetch Article_Name
# As implied, replace spaces with underscores. As with the actual site,
# the article name is case-sensitive.

# Get your preferred browser to visit said Wikipedia page
printf "What is your (text or graphical) browser of choice?\\n"
read -r CLIBROWSER

# Make a local copy of the requested article
curl -o /tmp/"$1".html https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/"$1"

# Huge step: actually opening the page
$CLIBROWSER /tmp/"$1".html
